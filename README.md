# Disclaimer

**This one is something from my good old days** - many years ago I've started working with java only to be able
to comfortably parse outputs of the SAS program.

Of course, I would reconsider a lot of things done here :)

This util is a desktop application on plain java to find issues in the log of executed SAS program.

- All dangerous message will be found and written to the file.
- This app can work with directories and exact file.

# Requirements

- java 8
- initially it wasn't wrapped with gradle, but I added it just to have modern approach and comfortability
- jar includes dependencies, so it's ready to just be used
